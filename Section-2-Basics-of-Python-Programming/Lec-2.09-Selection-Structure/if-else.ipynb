    "1. What is branching in programming languages?\n",
    "- Branching is a basic concept in computer science. It means an instruction that tells a computer to begin executing a different part of a program rather than executing statements one-by-one. Branching is implemented as a series of control flow statements in high-level programming languages.\n",
    "2. What is the purpose of the `if` statement in Python?\n",
    "3. What is the syntax of the `if` statement? Give an example.\n",
    "4. What is indentation? Why is it used?\n",
    "5. What is an indented block of statements?\n",
    "6. How do you perform indentation in Python?\n",
    "7. What happens if some code is not indented correctly?\n",
    "8. What happens when the condition within the `if` statement evaluates to `True`? What happens if the condition evaluates for `false`?\n",
    "9. How do you check if a number is even?\n",
    "10. What is the purpose of the `else` statement in Python?\n",
    "11. What is the syntax of the `else` statement? Give an example.\n",
    "12. Write a program that prints different messages based on whether a number is positive or negative.\n",
    "13. Can the `else` statement be used without an `if` statement?\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the `elif` statement in Python?\n",
    "15. What is the syntax of the `elif` statement? Give an example.\n",
    "16. Write a program that prints different messages for different months of the year.\n",
    "17. Write a program that uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements together.\n",
    "18. Can the `elif` statement be used without an `if` statement?\n",
    "- No\n",
    "19. Can the `elif` statement be used without an `else` statement?\n",
    "- Yes\n",
    "20. What is the difference between a chain of `if`, `elif`, `elif`… statements and a chain of `if`, `if`, `if`… statements? Give an example.\n",
    "- in elif if one statement becomes true only this block of code executes, it skips the other ones\n",
    "- in if..if...if all the statements executes rather it satifies the first if or not\n",
    "\n",
    "21. Can non-boolean conditions be used with `if` statements? Give some examples.\n",
    "22. What are nested conditional statements? How are they useful?\n",
    "23. Give an example of nested conditional statements.\n",
    "24. Why is it advisable to avoid nested conditional statements?\n",
    "- Although the indentation of the statements makes the structure apparent, nested conditionals become difficult to read very quickly. In general, it is a good idea to avoid them when you can\n",
    "25. What is the shorthand `if` conditional expression? \n",
    "- The ternary conditional operator is a short-hand method for writing an if/else statement. There are three components to the ternary operator: the expression/condition, the positive value, and the negative value. When the expression evaluates to true, the positive value is used—otherwise the negative value is used.\n",
    "26. What is the syntax of the shorthand `if` conditional expression? Give an example.\n",
    "27. What is the difference between the shorthand `if` expression and the regular `if` statement?\n",
    "28. What is a statement in Python?\n",
    "- in simple words, we can say anything written in Python is a statement. Python statement ends with the token NEWLINE character. It means each line in a Python script is a statement. For example, a = 10 is an assignment statement.\n",
    "29. What is an expression in Python?\n",
    "- An expression in Python is a combination of operators and operands. An example of expression can be : x = x + 1 0 x = x + 10 x=x+10.\n",
    "30. What is the difference between statements and expressions?\n",
    "31. Is every statement an expression? Give an example or counterexample.\n",
    "32. Is every expression a statement? Give an example or counterexample.\n",
    "33. What is the purpose of the pass statement in `if` blocks?\n",
    "34. Python does not have a switch or case statement. To get around this fact, one can use dictionary mapping. Try to implement code for this task.\n"
